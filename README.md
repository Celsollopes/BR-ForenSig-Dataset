# BR-ForenSig-Dataset
BR-ForenSig Dataset is a database composed of forensic analysis and Grafotécnica.

BR-ForenSig Dataset is a database composed of forensic analysis and Grafotécnica. This database includes eight sets of images: images of complete signatures, images of signatures presenting only the regions of the criteria arising from graphotechnical analysis and six sets resulting from the processing of signature verification systems integrated with interpretability methods. The label annotations of signature images generated from graphotechnical analyses are still part of the database. For each signature image, an associated XML contains the coordinates of the signature region and the name of the criterion identified in that region by graphotechnical experts.
